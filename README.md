# Lesson2-Jake-Rachel-Merge
Sandbox test of Git file merge based on "Combining Simple Files Using Original" in lesson 2 of Udacity Git course.

This repository was created to investigate what Git actually does if asked to merge two different versions of a file created by two different developers, Jake & Rachel. 

The merge scenario arose from questions about the material presented in two sections (linked below) of lesson 2 of the [Udacity](http://www.udacity.com) course [How to Use Git and GitHub](https://www.udacity.com/course/how-to-use-git-and-github--ud775).  

* [Combining Simple Files](https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer#!/c-ud775/l-2969618657/e-2960548791/m-2960548792)   
* [Combining Files Using Original](https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer#!/c-ud775/l-2969618657/e-2979648591/m-2990898647) 

The scenarios were taken from a discussion with the title 
[Lesson 2 Merging Concept](https://discussions.udacity.com/t/lesson-2-merging-concept/160831) 
in the Udacity discussion forum for the course ["How to Use Git & GitHub"](https://www.udacity.com/course/how-to-use-git-and-github--ud775).
